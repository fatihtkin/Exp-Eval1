Sure! Here are several experiment scenarios with different independent, control, and dependent variables. This will help you explore various aspects of the sorting algorithms' performance.

Experiment Scenario 1: Impact of Input Array Size
Independent Variable:
The size of the input array to be sorted (e.g., 100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000 elements).
Control Variables:
Type of input data (e.g., all random integer arrays).
Hardware and software environment (same machine, same JVM version, etc.).
Number of repetitions (e.g., each algorithm is run 20 times on each input size).
Sorting algorithm (run all four algorithms on the same input sizes).
Dependent Variable:
Execution time of the sorting algorithms for each input size.
This experiment examines how the performance of each sorting algorithm scales as the input size increases.

Experiment Scenario 2: Effect of Input Data Type
Independent Variable:
Type of input data (random, sorted, reverse sorted, nearly sorted).
Control Variables:
Input size (e.g., fixed at 10,000 elements for all cases).
Hardware and software environment (same machine, same JVM version, etc.).
Number of repetitions (e.g., 20 repetitions for each data type).
Sorting algorithm (same four algorithms for each data type).
Dependent Variable:
Execution time for each sorting algorithm on different input data types.
This experiment explores how well each algorithm performs on different types of input data. For example, some algorithms may perform much better on nearly sorted arrays than on random arrays.

Experiment Scenario 3: Impact of Array Element Range (Data Distribution)
Independent Variable:
The range of the integers in the input array (e.g., [0, 10], [0, 1,000], [0, 100,000]).
Control Variables:
Input size (e.g., fixed at 10,000 elements for all arrays).
Type of data (random integers within the specified range).
Hardware and software environment (same machine, same JVM version, etc.).
Number of repetitions (e.g., 20 repetitions for each range).
Sorting algorithm (same four algorithms for each range).
Dependent Variable:
Execution time for sorting algorithms with different ranges of array elements.
This experiment investigates whether the range of integer values in the array affects the sorting time. Some algorithms may be more sensitive to the distribution of element values (e.g., small vs. large numbers).

Experiment Scenario 4: Impact of Array Length Variability
Independent Variable:
The length variability of the input arrays (e.g., arrays with a small range of lengths like 500-510 vs. arrays with a large range like 500-5000).
Control Variables:
Data type (all random arrays).
Number of repetitions (e.g., 20 repetitions for each range of lengths).
Hardware and software environment (same machine, same JVM version, etc.).
Sorting algorithm (same four algorithms for each range).
Dependent Variable:
Execution time for sorting algorithms with different variability in array lengths.
This experiment looks at how the sorting algorithms handle arrays of varying lengths. It’s useful if the algorithms will be applied to scenarios where data sizes change frequently.

Experiment Scenario 5: Effect of Initial Array State (Random vs. Partially Sorted)
Independent Variable:
Degree of "sortedness" in the input data (e.g., arrays that are 100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, and 0% sorted).
Control Variables:
Input size (e.g., fixed at 10,000 elements).
Data type (e.g., integers).
Hardware and software environment (same machine, same JVM version, etc.).
Number of repetitions (e.g., 20 repetitions for each "sortedness" level).
Sorting algorithm (same four algorithms for each "sortedness" level).
Dependent Variable:
Execution time for each sorting algorithm at different levels of initial array sortedness.
This experiment measures how efficient each algorithm is when the input is already partially sorted. Some algorithms like bubble sort tend to perform much faster when the data is nearly sorted, while others might not benefit as much.

Experiment Scenario 6: Impact of Multi-threading (If Algorithms Support It)
Independent Variable:
Number of threads used for sorting (1 thread vs. multiple threads, if your algorithms support parallel execution).
Control Variables:
Input size (e.g., fixed at 50,000 elements).
Data type (e.g., random integers).
Hardware and software environment (same machine, same JVM version, same CPU cores).
Number of repetitions (e.g., 20 repetitions for each threading configuration).
Dependent Variable:
Execution time for each sorting algorithm with different numbers of threads.
This experiment would be relevant if some of the algorithms (like QuickSortGPT) are able to utilize multiple threads for faster sorting. You can test how well the algorithms scale with parallel execution.

Experiment Scenario 7: Impact of JVM Warm-up (Performance Over Time)
Independent Variable:
Execution round number (e.g., round 1, round 2, round 3, ... up to round 100).
Control Variables:
Input size (e.g., fixed at 100,000 elements).
Data type (e.g., random integers).
Hardware and software environment (same machine, same JVM version, etc.).
Sorting algorithm (same four algorithms for each round).
Dependent Variable:
Execution time over successive runs.
This experiment tracks whether execution times change as the JVM "warms up" over multiple runs. The JVM may optimize the code during repeated executions, resulting in faster sorting after the initial few rounds.

Experiment Scenario 8: Cache Effects on Sorting Performance
Independent Variable:
Array size relative to the CPU cache size (e.g., small arrays that fit in cache vs. large arrays that don’t).
Control Variables:
Data type (e.g., random integers).
Hardware and software environment (same machine, same JVM version).
Number of repetitions (e.g., 20 repetitions for each array size).
Sorting algorithm (same four algorithms for each array size).
Dependent Variable:
Execution time depending on whether the array fits in the CPU cache.
This experiment looks at the impact of CPU cache on sorting performance. Sorting large arrays that don’t fit in the cache may cause performance degradation, which can be useful to understand for algorithms used on large datasets.

Summary of the Design Components
Independent Variables: Factors you manipulate (e.g., algorithm, input size, data type).
Control Variables: Factors you keep constant to ensure fair comparisons (e.g., hardware, number of repetitions).
Dependent Variables: The outcome you measure (e.g., execution time).
